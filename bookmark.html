  	<h3 align="center">Design Process</a></h3>

  	<p>The beginning of the bookmark creation process included making 5 sketches to choose from that would be apropriate for elementary school kids. This was done using various methods, but in this case, an iPad Pro was used to create the thumbnails to the left.</p>

    <p>The librarian provided some information in order to refine the designs based on the kids at Pequea Elementary's interests, being dinosaurs, animals, and fantasy creatures. The bookmarks were to be printed in black ink, creating white space for the kids to color in themselves, and with 1/8th of an inch margins. Once the thumbnail sketches were created, a design was chosen based on what the kids would enjoy most while also meeting the previously listed requirements. </p>

    <p>The dinosaur coloring page style bookmark was chosen for further development. </p>

    <h3 align="center">Printing Process</a></h3>

    <p>Designs were organized in groups of 4 to increase efficiency and printed onto a lithography plate to prepare for reproduction.</p>

    <p>Lithography plates were then taken to the Millersville Print Lab, pictured on the left, to begin the printing and cutting process. Students cleaned, maintained, and set up the machine with guided instruction and printed a minimum of 75 sheets.  </p>

    <p>Bookmarks were then cut and organized by design and sent to Pequea Elementary. </p>
