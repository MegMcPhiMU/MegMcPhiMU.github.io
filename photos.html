<p align="center"> Take four photos, two inside and two outside, and edit them using Adobe Photoshop in order to learn the capabilities of the program. </p>

    <p>The original photo (left) was taken using an iPhone 14 Pro using the rule of thirds to center the puppy
in the frame. Photo taken right before sunset with the subject about 4 feet away and rapidly approaching.The photo is a bit blurry due to the movement captured. </p>

<p>The edited photo (right) included some minor cropping work to center the puppy in the frame and reduce visual noise. The midtones were adjusted to brighten the overall subject and sharpened the image to create clearer edges. Colors of the overall image were tweaked to bring out more warmer tones in the background so the yellow frisbee would be a bit less striking. I also edited out the wood pile, swing set, and fence from the background.</p>

    <h3 align="center">Streetside Sunset</a></h3>

    <p>The original photo (left) was taken at sunset using an iPhone 14 Pro using the rule of thirds to create asymmetry between the sky and the power lines. Leading lines were used to line up the power lines in an aesthetically pleasing manner. The road was used to create contrast between the dark and light values.</p>

    <p>The edited photo (right) includes darkening the overall image using auto color to make the gradient in the sky more cohesive and even the contrast between the road and the sunset. The car, lights, and reflected street signs were also removed to decrease visual noise and make the photo look more polished.</p>

    <p>The original photo (left) was taken just before sunset using an iPhone 14 Pro. Leading lines were used to position the tree branches to create a more cohesive overall look in the image.</p>

    <p>The edited photo (right) includes manually darkened midtones to increase the vibrancy of the moon. Auto color and auto tone were used to bring out the warmer colors of the sunset at the bottom of the image. The overall image was cropped to create an asymmetrical focal point.</p>

    <p>The original photo (left) was taken around mid-afternoon using an iPhone 14 Pro. Framing was used to try to center the cat because if the foam base behind him he would stop playing to see why. The vantage point was changed to keep the subject primarily on the blue carpet to create contrast. The subject was about 3 feet away.</p>

    <p>The edited photo (right) includes brightening the colors using auto color to bring out the details of his face. Some pet hair was removed from the floor around him to decrease the visual noise of the photo. The image was also zoomed in and cropped accordingly to reinforce the cat as the focal point.</p>
